# The B Hive 

To whom it may concern, my name is Brandon Littlejohn. I recently completed a full-stack web development bootcamp. While I was attending the online class and trying to get a better understanding of the materials it became very apperent the affect adhd has on my information processing, time management, fulfiling my duties in my house, my self esteem and emotional wellbeing. Due to a genetic defect us adhd folks have an issue with dopamine signaling, and if you don't know dopamine is what helps us as humans decide what is an immediate priority of attention. with an adhd brain I felt constantly overwhelmed with all the tasks I needed to accomplish, overly critical of myself and the work I produced, to the point where it was heavily affecting my mental, emotional, and physical wellbeing. I began to slack on my studies, shut down, doubt my intelligence. I even started thinking to myself "welp back to the warehouse since i'll never be able to write code as well as anyone else" but fortunately for me i'm very stubborn and did not give up. My parents always told me things like:
'an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure'
meaning if you do what you can to eliminate the problem before it occurs then there is no problem to begin with

## what was the problem?

My house is constantly disorganized! We all have issues with managing our time, decision making, general exhaustion from work. and because of this it can get chaotic at times, thats not a very learning friendly environment. I aim to relieve some of the stress of managing the house with the b hive.

## Put yourself in my shoes for a moment

One issue I'd constantly run into is after hours and hours of watching lectures, reading documentation, debbugging my code. I'd step out of my little cave and realize "oh shit I forgot to cook dinner", or play with the dogs, pick up ingredients/supplies. Then my mind starts getting all confused as to what to do now. All because there was never a plan to begin with, little to no structure in our routine. Can't plan dinner without knowing what you have in your pantry. And looking through the pantry trying to figure out what to make is a waste of cognitive energy. NOT TO MENTION even if I did have an idea as to what to make... What about the portions?!? who's going to be home? Did they already eat? Duh just text them and ask...

no reply's at all. looks like this is going to be a solo mission...

## Not anymore!!!

My thought process was wow it'd be nice if there was an app of some sort where I can keep track of my families schedules/plans for the week. Have all of our recipes we like stored somewhere where its easy to access and have something to keep track of ingredients we have on hand, Keep in touch with ou... oh wait, I can code!!! 

### With the b hive you and your family can:

* Keep track of your b's schedules
* Manage your hive inventory
* Store your favorite recipes 
* Dinner voting system based off of ingredents you have on hand 

And much more in the future
